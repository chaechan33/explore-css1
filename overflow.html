            People often think things like money or luxury lead to happiness, but research indicates some healthy life
            practices may actually be the key. Simple experiences like spending time with friends and family or
            practicing gratitude may promote a healthier outlook on life. Looking for ways to shift negative thinking?
            Want to increase positivity in your life? Ready to put that gratitude journal to good use? Here are five
            ways you can boost your happiness on a daily basis.

        <h3>Expressing gratitude has been shown to do more than improve your mood. People who write down a few positive
            things about their day are healthier, more energetic, less stressed and anxious and get better sleep. The
            key is to make this a regular habit and do it with intention. Think about creating a small gratitude ritual.
            For example, every morning when you have your coffee you could think of three things that you appreciate
            about the day before.

            Or make it a habit to jot down three good things about your day before you go to bed at night. Your three
            good things can be really small â€” perhaps you saw something beautiful or just appreciate being healthy that
            day. In fact, science shows that it's the small everyday experiences that make us happier, as compared to
            big life events.</h3>

            Surround Yourself with Positive People
            Happiness is contagious. Dr. Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler, researchers at Harvard and The University
            of San Diego, found that each additional happy friend increases a person's probability of being happy by
            about nine percent. If you're feeling down, reach out to a friend or colleague who generally has a more
            positive attitude. Our brains have mirror neurons that will literally mimic what the other person is
            expressing. So when you need a bit of positive infusion, connect with those who share it.

            Do Regular Acts of Kindness
            Research has shown that spending money on others makes us happier than spending money on ourselves and doing
            small acts of kindness increases life satisfaction. Hold the door for the person behind you, say thank you
            and mean it when you get your drink from the coffee shop, pick up your colleague's favorite snack and leave
            it on their desk for them. Even the smallest nice gesture can make someone's day.

            Spend More Time with Family and Friends
            Having friends can save your life. Low social interaction can be as bad for you as smoking 15 cigarettes a
            day and is twice as bad for your health as obesity. Even if you're busy, you can find ways to connect with
            people you care about. Use your lunch break as an opportunity to call a friend or, if possible, take a walk
            together. If you're busy during the week, how about inviting your friend to do some errands together on the
            weekend?
